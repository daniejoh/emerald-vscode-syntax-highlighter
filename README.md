# emerald-syntax-highlighting README

A simple syntax highlighter for the emerald programming language.

Info about Emerald can be found on: [a link](http://www.emeraldprogramminglanguage.org/)

Note!: This was put together as fast as possible. The naming is probably wrong in a lot of places.

## How to develop and test

Better described in vsc-extension-quickstart.md

In short: Open the folder in vscode. Press F5 to start a development vscode that has this extention installed.

Use "Developer: Inspect TM Scopes" to see what kind of scope a token has gotten. Great for debugging.

The scope inspector can be used on all languages, so I recommend having e.g. a typescript file with code to compare with.

Also, the names in the "name" fields are predefined! They are not random. They should however end with ".emerald".

## Features

Shows the keywords defined in the language as well as arrows etc.

## Requirements

None


## Known Issues

None, but there is probably a lot of them.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the highlighter
